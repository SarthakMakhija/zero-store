1. Transactions and its impact on Get
2. Key should support timestamp
3. Recovery
4. Manifest
5. Scan
6. Performance testing
7. Cache
    - SegmentCache (or maybe block cache)
    - Key Cache
    - KeyRange Cache
8. Client interface
9. Hide all non-client abstractions
10. Compaction
11. Segment Cleaner (remove segments if their reference count is zero)
12. Set should allow clients to wait till the entire in-memory segment becomes durable
13. Mutex in StorageState
14. Validate key and value size; look at the size in block/block builder
    (also add other validations in client facing APIs)
15. Documentation
16. Metrics
17. Flush an immutable in-memory segment to object store
18. Persistent segment : done
