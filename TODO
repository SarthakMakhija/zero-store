1. Transactions and its impact on Get
2. Key should support timestamp
3. Recovery
4. Manifest
5. Scan
6. Performance testing
7. Cache
    - SegmentCache (or maybe block cache)
    - Key Cache
    - KeyRange Cache
8. Persistent segment with bloom filter/cuckoo filter at page boundary
9. Client interface
10. Hide all non-client abstractions
11. Compaction
12. Segment Cleaner (remove segments if their reference count is zero)
13. Set should allow clients to wait till the entire in-memory segment becomes durable
14. Persistent segment
15. Mutex in StorageState
16. Validate key and value size; look at the size in block/block builder
    (also add other validations in client facing APIs)
